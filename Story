Once upon a time there lived a wizard in a forest full of Redwood trees. 
The wizard took a walk every morning with his companion, a large crow. 
As the two were wandering the forest, suddenly the crow flew away in a hurry.
The wizard was not startled that the crow flew off, because he knew his fondness for soaring above the treetops,
but given that the wizard was in the middle of a story it was unusual for the crow not to listen.
Afterall, the wizard told great stories. Unsure of why the why had taken off so abruptly, but trusting that it must be for good reason,
the wizard took a sharp right and followed suit. He had to know what had called the crow's attention, and perhaps even ask for an apology.
